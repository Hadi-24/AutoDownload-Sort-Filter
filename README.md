# 🧬 AutoDownload-Filter-Sort: Genomic Variant Curation Tool

This tool automates the process of downloading, parsing, filtering, and sorting variant data (e.g., from ClinVar) for genomic and bioinformatics research. This helps simplify large-scale variant curation by focusing on key clinical attributes such as pathogenicity and variant type (SNPs, SVs).

## 🔍 Features

- Automated download of ClinVar VCF/TSV data
- Filtering based on:
  - Clinical significance (Pathogenic, Likely Pathogenic)
  - Variant type (SNPs, SVs)
- Output of cleaned, curated files for downstream analysis
- Easily customizable: supports modular edits and flexible logic for specific research needs
